# 3D Engine, Turn-Based Strategy Game and AI

This is an engine, game and AI developed for my BSc Computer Science dissertation. 
The code is C/C++, written in the data-oriented style (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc), 
using BGFX for rendering, GLFW for windows and input, GLM for math and stb for image and ttf font loading.
